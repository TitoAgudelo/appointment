### overview
[Custom elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/) provide a way for authors to build their own fully-featured DOM elements. Although authors could always use non-standard elements in their documents, with application-specific behaviour added after the fact by scripting or similar, such elements have historically been non-conforming and not very functional. By defining a custom element, authors can inform the parser how to properly construct an element and how elements of that class should react to changes. Custom elements are part of a larger effort to "rationalise the platform", by explaining existing platform features (like the elements of HTML) in terms of lower-level author-exposed extensibility points (like custom element definition). Although today there are many limitations on the capabilities of custom elements—both functionally and semantically—that prevent them from fully explaining the behaviours of HTML's existing elements, we hope to shrink this gap over time.

[ES6](http://es6-features.org/), it’s a new JavaScript implementation. of the new generation of javascript than with new characteristics can be easier implement like you just do with frameworks of javascript.
